Manage state of nodes 

Treat changes to "ansible/plays/setup" a bit differently == vanilla state


how??

test nodes should auto-sync upon sucessfull build of Docker Image && match state of ansible playbook definition 

- build docker image *
- track docker tags for troubleshooting && refrence. 
- define basic state of nodes.
- define roles that bring the playbook together.
